## Few words from us :mega:

Our idea was to give you scenarios from a wide range of software development career paths.  
Feel free to interpret them openly, the goal is to create something cool and scenarios are more of the guideline.

If you feel that you don't know how to start or you struggle with something for too long feel free to give us a call, we will try to break it through together.

**_Have Fun!_**:smile:

## Scenario 1

#### Target: File Share App :inbox_tray:

#### Level: Medium

Create file share service, for example, in-between students, managed via UI, all kinds of platforms are welcome. Think of it like an app that you would like to use with your friends during working on student projects, a shared file repository, that authenticated users can view or upload to. You can send files through HTTP or any other protocol.

Improvements suggestions:

- make your solution secure
- implement public/private files mechanism
- add social functionality (eg. local chat, comments)
- handle large files with async upload

## Scenario 2

#### Target: Coronavirus visualisation :chart_with_upwards_trend:

#### Level: Hard

The world is grappling with 2019-nCoV, the new Coronavirus spreading rapidly from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, the capital of Chinaâ€™s Hubei Province. That virus spreads via human-to-human transmission, it is essential to understand transmission patterns and rates to establish emergency response plans. Your goal is to create a data visualisation, which shows the spread of the disease worldwide, the infection speed or overview over cases. It can be achieved via a web page as well as desktop apps, absolutely free technique, as long as your solution is data-driven.

_Data:_

## Scenario 3

#### Target: Biometric Recognition :detective:

#### Level: Medium-Hard

The idea of this scenario is to use Biometric Recognition for basically what name says, identifying people. There are plenty of implementations of this idea from the doorbell camera able to recognise your roommates to a school security system. Use either machine learning models, or for someone less experienced there are plenty easy to implement python libraries. We want you to create something using this technology, what you can use it for?

_You probably have heard about face recognition, the most famous one, but have you heard about ear recognition, huh?

## Scenario 4

#### Target: Game :video_game:

#### Level: Easy-Medium

Hackathon is always a good place for creating a game with a bunch of friends, that is why we would include it as well. The topic of the game is open, your own version of Flappy Brid is a good area to pick for starters, for someone more experienced we would recommend to consider a game that can at the same time learn you to code - Codewars challenges are a good example.

We would like you to think about the game that other Hackers could play during event, try making competition spirit stronger during Hack! :D

## Scenario 5

#### Target: Smart-mirror home page :desktop_computer:

#### Level: Easy (targeted for Hackers who just starting their journey)

Smart mirror becomes recently very popular way to make your home "smart", cool part about them is that they are actually not that hard to make on of them by yourself, in this scenario we would focus on software part of it, designing and developing home page for your smart mirror. It would be good to include weather forecast data or you can think about any other information or feature that would be useful for you, (simple tic-tac-toe just to make your everyday teeth brushing a little bit more funny is also a thing).
As an extension, you can implement a CMS to easily edit content in the future.

## Scenario 6

#### Target: Real-time monitoring system :stopwatch:

#### Level: Easy-Medium-Hard

Ability to create real-time monitoring systems is desired in almost every industry. Well optimized, fast and performant systems can bring fortune to the company. This task is open to any system that collects data from some sort of emitter and displays it to the user in a meaningful way.

Examples:

**_Easy_**  
A desktop application that logs all websites visited by current PC user and displays diagrams/tabular data.

**_Medium_**  
A mobile app that uses one of the device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, barometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, pedometer etc.) and transmits it to a database. Within the same, or with another mobile/web application display data to end-user. The simple fitness app is an example of this difficulty level.

**_Hard_**  
Same as easy and medium, but this time system implements communication between an external device (smartwatches, Arduino etc) which involves using some 3rd-party SDK.

## Scenario 7

#### Target: Trade platform :shirt:

#### Level: Easy

A lot of people throw their belongings on the road when most of the times those items didn't suffer any damage and they could still be used by somebody else in need.
Your task is to design an app where those items can be listed and picked up by the ones in need free of charge instead of being thrown at the edge of the road. The app should support user registration, login, the items should be listed in categories and the system should provide a search field with filters for location and item category.

## Scenario 8

#### Target: Fake articles :hankey:

#### Level: Medium

Fake news websites gained so much popularity lately that is challenging to tell which articles are fake or not. The young ones don't fall that easily into that pit, but the older ones often take the bite and believe all they find over the internet.
Your task is to design a neuronal network which can determine whether an article is fraudulent or not by the passing the link of the article as input.
SUGGESTION: Try to look up the name of the article on google and grab the first page of results.

## Scenario 9

#### Target: Game Map Generator & Visualisation :world_map:

#### Level: Easy-Medium

Maybe do you play D&D? What about map generator based on some configuration file? The idea of this scenario is to create a game map generator that can be based on an algorithm or on a random seed. It would be cool to somehow visualise generated map 2D, 3D, 4D? We rather make you think about this scenario as about logical challenge.

_Maybe something with fractals, genetic algorithm?_

## Scenario 10

#### Target: E2ee Chat :lock:

#### Level: Hard

I'd say is fair to assume that our privacy is the most important thing that we got, even tho not so many of us realize how dangerous the internet can be. More and more often you can see people intercepting the wireless traffic in populated areas such as airports, coffee shops or bars with the aid of small computers such as raspberry pi. Most of the times the channel that you use to communicate with your beloved ones, share pictures and videos are not that secure as you would probably think.
Your task is to design a safe way of communication where parties can interact per to per or in groups in real-time and also be implementing end-to-end encryption.
Besides that, they also have to be able to share pictures, videos or any other files.
